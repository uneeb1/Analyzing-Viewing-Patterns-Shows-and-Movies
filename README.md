# Analyzing-Viewing-Patterns-Shows-and-Movies
Project Overview This project delves into personal viewing habits using a dataset of movies and TV shows. Initially inspired by a collection of recommendations found on sticky notes, the analysis investigates what types of media were consumed, the time commitment involved, and the sources of these recommendations. The project leverages data analysis techniques to draw insights from the viewing patterns.

# Objectives
Analyze viewing patterns to understand the frequency and type of content consumed. Visualize trends across genres, sources (e.g., streaming platforms), and time spent. Explore possible factors influencing viewing choices.

# Features
Data Cleaning: Preprocesses the raw dataset (unclean_movie_data.xlsx) to handle inconsistencies. Interactive Widgets: Includes interactive elements using ipywidgets for dynamic data exploration. Visualization: Generates charts and graphs to represent viewing trends. Recommendations: Examines common recommendations and sources for content.
